    <!--<script type="text/javascript">
      // type="text/javascript" This is not necessary but it is good to write it.
      console.log("Sadeepal Sumudupriya"); // This is used to write something to the console and take the output from console. String is a character sequence. Semicolon at the end of the statement is not necessary.

      // When we write or load JavaScript, it must be written or loaded at the end of the <body> tag. The reason for this is for manytimes JavaScript is containing some parts of the codes or scripts which we perform changes in HTML or otherwise the DOM manipulate or otherwise in the HTML files. The problem is if we load JavaScript at the beginnig, as the HTML parts are not loaded when JavaScript loads, then it will give errors. Because we point out to do particular changes in a particular HTML tags, or a HTML tag with particular classes, or a HTML tag with particular ids. So in such kind of situations, when the script parts are loaded, then the errors will be shown like "HTML parts are not defined" as HTML parts are not loaded. JavaScript or script executes line by line like Interpreter. So then there is no problem because the tags want to the DOM manipulate had been loaded.

      alert("This is an alert");

    <!-- First the HTML parts must be loaded. Second the CSS parts must be loaded. Third the JavaScript must be loaded. Because that is the regular order. Normally HTML and CSS are loaded together. Then the JavaScript parts. Because HTML is the structure of the website. CSS beautify the website. JavaScript gives the functionalities to the website. -->
